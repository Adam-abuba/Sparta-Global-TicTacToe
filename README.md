# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Breif
The objective here was to create a Tic Tac Toe game within a blank html page, having the code construction start from the provided code. The game was to allow two players to take turns in placing their sign in a 3x3 grid. There was also to be a function that allowed the page to detect when the game round has finished and also for the score to be kept.

In addition there was also to be a button that allowed players to reset the board when needed.


## What went well
The state of the game currently allows for players to place their respective sign in a box. The box sign is then locked in, in order to prevent the next player from re-assigning their own sign to that box.

The reset button is able to function by removing all signs across the grid however does not allow for the game to be started again by players putting in their sign once the button has been clicked.

## Challenges
* Getting reset function to allow a new game to start
* Figuring out how to stop the game when a clear winner has been decided rather than when all boxes are filled.
* Figuring out how to display the score in jQuery.


##What has been delivered
* Naughts and cross can be placed.
* The players can putting in their sign one after another.
* Signs are locked in so can not be overwritten with another sign.
* Reset button clears the board.
